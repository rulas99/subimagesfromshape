In this repository I present two programs to obtain subimages from a given a raster and a shapefile:

* In the first directory yo will find a script that extracts subimages that contains (in the center) all the points of a given shp

* In the second directory yo will find a script that extracts subimages that doesnt contains the points of a given shp

The motivitation of making this, is create training and testing datasets for computer vision algorithms
